# FastLED-Effects
A bunch of different FastLED effects.

Each directory contains a single arduino sketch. Each sketch includes all of the required methods for the effect as well as an example. To use these, simply copy all of the functions to your arduino project and follow the example sketch. Make sure that your LED strip is called `leds`.
